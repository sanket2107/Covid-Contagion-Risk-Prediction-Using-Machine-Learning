COVID-19 Infection Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains code and data for a study on predicting the risk of COVID-19 contagion based on demographic, health, and environmental characteristics using machine learning techniques. The goal of this research is to develop a method that outperforms baseline models and can aid in forecasting the spread of COVID-19, as well as assist in the development of improved safety measures to combat the disease.

Study Overview
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a crisis in global health, emphasizing the need for precise and timely infection risk prediction. In this study, we propose a machine learning-based technique that considers the relationships between demographic, health, and environmental factors to predict the risk of COVID-19 contagion. By utilizing a freely accessible dataset, we compare the performance of various machine learning models and demonstrate the superiority of our suggested strategy over baseline models.
